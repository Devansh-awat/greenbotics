**This Incredible Repository**
====

Welcome to the Greenbotics 2025 repository! This repository contains everything we've worked on over the past five months, including all our code and resources. You can also use this repository as a complete guide to understand and reconstruct the robot from the ground up.

Hi! I'm Sheel. I'm 15, and this year, I'm doing my second WRO season. Last year, along with Devansh, our team made it to the International Finals in the Robomission Junior category. Alongside Robotics I'm learning competetive debate. I kinda suck though. I have a dog, and both of us are obsessed with Monkeys.

I'm Rakshith, a 9th grader passionate about robotics and aspiring to study engineering in Germany. I spend my time building drones, experimenting with sensors, and tackling tough math and physics problems. Beyond tech, I love table tennis, and write imaginative futuristic scripts.

I have 3 dogs - Riki, Cookie, and Cream. Cookie and Cream live with my grandparents in Hyderabdad.

Mr.Paresh Gambhava is our chief coach from The Robotronics Club Ahmedabad. He is a robotics enthusiast, engineer by profession, and teacher at heart. He has his degree in Electronics engineering and has been the chief coach at The Robotronics Club since 10 years. He has a deep experience in training students for different Robotics competition and projects. We are fortunate to learn from him the ethical practice, guidance and fundamentals.

**The Challenge**

The [Future Engineer Challenge](hhttps://wro-association.org/wp-content/uploads/WRO-2025-Future-Engineers-Self-Driving-Cars-General-Rules.pdf "Vew the season rulebook") for the 2025 WRO Season involves building an autonomous vehicle that can complete two challenges. The first challenge is the Open Challenge. This challenge involves the robot completing three full laps on the field. The field consists of outer boundary walls, and 4 inner walls that are randomly placed to form a closed rectangle.

The second challenge is the Obstacle Challenge. In the Obstacle Challenge red or green cuboids called Traffic Signs are placed along the course. The robot must complete three laps around the track white making sure to pass the red traffic signs from the left, and the green traffic signs from the right. The Obstacle Challenge also has a dedicated Parking Space. The robot must start and end in the parking space to attain full points. The walls placement is fixed for the Obstacle Challenge.

Having spend a lot of time working on Lego based hardware in the 2024 season, we chose to use Lego for our Robot's Hardware. However the robot also uses a Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi camera, and other off the shelf electronic components.

## The Structure of This Repository

* `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members)
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
* `schemes` contains one or several schematic diagrams in form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
* `models` is for the files for models used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.
* `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition. It may include documentation how to connect to a SBC/SBM and upload files there, datasets, hardware specifications, communication protocols descriptions etc. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.
